# Investment-Portfolio Analysis

### Stock selection

The complete code for this project is available at
`Investment-Portafolio-Analysis.R`

First we will take a series of stocks with which we are going to
analyze. These actions were a personal choice but the analysis can be
performed with any set of actions. Future projects will explore methods
for choosing a portfolio of financial assets. The shares selected with
their corresponding percentages are in the portfolio the following:

| STOCKS | WEIGHT |
|--------|--------|
| TSLA   | 25%    |
| AAPL   | 25%    |
| AMZN   | 20%    |
| NFLX   | 15%    |
| GOOG   | 15%    |

Letâ€™s take a look at the dataset to see what format it will take.
